### How to use
* Either install the required packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt` and run it with
`python main.py algorithm_name` inside of the `src` folder

**OR**

* Run `pipenv install -r requirements.txt` and then run the script with
`pipenv run python main.py algorithm_name` inside of the `src` folder

You can add your own algorithms using the same template as `algorithms/bubblesort.py`
